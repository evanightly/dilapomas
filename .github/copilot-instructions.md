# RRI Complaint System - Project Instructions

This document provides detailed technical instructions for developing the RRI (Radio Republik Indonesia) complaint management system.

This is a Laravel 12 and ReactJS project with a focus on modularity, maintainability, and scalability. The project is designed to handle complex business logic through a repository-service pattern and an intent-based system for routing requests.
The goal is to create a clean and efficient codebase that adheres to best practices in both Laravel and ReactJS development.
The project is built with a focus on TypeScript for the frontend, ensuring type safety and maintainability. The backend is built with Laravel 11, utilizing the latest features and best practices in PHP development and more importantly this project is containerized with docker to simplify project setup for development and production environment.

The main business process is a complaint management application for RRI based on Peraturan Direktur Utama No. 06 Tahun 2023. The system handles two types of complaints:

1. **Pengaduan Berkadar Pengawasan** (Surveillance-based complaints)
2. **Pengaduan Tidak Berkadar Pengawasan** (Non-surveillance complaints)

The project is built with TypeScript for the frontend, Laravel 12 for the backend, and is containerized with Docker for simplified development and production environments.

This project is developed using Laravel, Inertia React, MariaDB, I usually use ShadcnUI and MagicUI (https://magicui.design/) as a component library, I also use service repository patterns (https://github.com/adobrovolsky97/laravel-repository-service-pattern) in developing applications, and use tanstack queries and tables to optimize data manipulation.

This project is mainly developed using linux, so please handle the PowerShell's command separator syntax, and this project is containerized with docker, so it will run in docker environment, and i will use docker-compose to run the project in development and production environment.

This project is using tailwind v4, so the implementation is quite different, like we dont need to use tailwind.config.js to configure the tailwind, we can just use app.css to configure it.

## Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel 12
- **Frontend**: ReactJS with TypeScript
- **Inertia**: Laravel and ReactJS adapter
- **Database**: MariaDB
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI, MagicUI
- **Form Stepper**: Stepperize (https://stepperize.vercel.app/)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Validation**: Zod (frontend), Laravel Requests (backend)
- **Containerization**: Docker

Note: this is a typescript project, safe typing is my priority for this project scalability, and windows is my main operating system, but this project will run in docker environment

## Crucial Dependencies

### Backend

- https://github.com/adobrovolsky97/laravel-repository-service-pattern : to handle service and repository process, decouple the application's business logic from the specific implementation details of data storage

### Frontend

- @tanstack/react-query : to handle data transaction process (look at the implementation of the serviceHooksFactory.ts)
- MagicUI : ReactJS component library, similar with ShadCN but with enhancement of animation and offers unique components

## Project Flow and Architecture

### Overall Data Flow

1. **Frontend Request Initiation**:

    - React components call methods from appropriate service hooks (e.g., `postServiceHook.useCreate()`)
    - Service hooks are created using the `serviceHooksFactory` pattern which standardizes CRUD operations
    - Custom operations use the intent parameter system to trigger specialized logic

2. **Frontend to Backend Communication**:

    - TanStack Query manages API requests, caching, and state invalidation
    - Requests flow through Inertia.js to Laravel backend
    - The `intent` query parameter determines which business logic to execute

3. **Backend Processing**:
    - Controllers receive requests and delegate to appropriate service based on intent
    - Services contain business logic and call repositories for data operations
    - Repositories handle direct data manipulation using Eloquent models
    - Results are transformed through Laravel Resources and returned to frontend

### Frontend Service Hook Pattern

The service hook pattern is built around the `serviceHooksFactory.ts` which:

```typescript
// Standard pattern for all service hooks
export const someModelServiceHook = {
    ...serviceHooksFactory<SomeModelResource>({
        baseRoute: ROUTES.SOME_MODELS,
        baseKey: TANSTACK_QUERY_KEYS.SOME_MODELS,
    }),
    // Custom methods for specific business logic
    useCustomOperation: () => {
        return createMutation({
            mutationFn: async (params) => {
                return mutationApi({
                    method: 'post',
                    url: route(`${ROUTES.SOME_MODELS}.store`),
                    data: params,
                    params: { intent: IntentEnum.SOME_MODEL_CUSTOM_OPERATION },
                });
            },
            invalidateQueryKeys: [{ queryKey: [TANSTACK_QUERY_KEYS.SOME_MODELS], exact: false }],
        });
    },
};
```

### Intent System

The intent system routes specific business logic through generic CRUD endpoints:

1. **Frontend**: Intent is specified in the request parameters:

    ```typescript
    params: {
        intent: IntentEnum.SOME_MODEL_CUSTOM_OPERATION;
    }
    ```

2. **Backend Controller**: Controller checks for intent and routes accordingly:

    ```php
    // Typical controller method with intent routing
    public function store(StoreSomeModelRequest $request)
    {
        $intent = $request->get('intent', IntentEnum::DEFAULT_STORE);

        switch($intent) {
            case IntentEnum::SOME_MODEL_CUSTOM_OPERATION:
                return $this->someModelService->customOperation($request->validated());
            default:
                return $this->someModelService->store($request->validated());
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Form Request Validation**: Each intent may have specific validation rules:

    ```php
    // Form request with intent-specific validation
    public function rules(): array
    {
        $rules = [
            'name' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],
            'description' => ['nullable', 'string']
        ];

        $intent = $this->get('intent', IntentEnum::DEFAULT_STORE);

        if ($intent === IntentEnum::SOME_MODEL_CUSTOM_OPERATION) {
            $rules['additional_field'] = ['required', 'array'];
        }

        return $rules;
    }
    ```

### Repository-Service Pattern

1. **Services**: Contain business logic, call repositories, handle events:

    ```php
    // Service implementation
    class SomeModelService implements SomeModelServiceInterface
    {
        public function __construct(
            protected SomeModelRepositoryInterface $someModelRepository
        ) {}

        public function customOperation(array $data)
        {
            // Business logic implementation
            $result = $this->someModelRepository->customQuery($data);
            event(new CustomOperationEvent($result));
            return $result;
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Repositories**: Handle data operations using Eloquent:

    ```php
    // Repository implementation
    class SomeModelRepository extends BaseRepository implements SomeModelRepositoryInterface
    {
        public function __construct(SomeModel $model)
        {
            parent::__construct($model);
        }

        public function customQuery(array $data)
        {
            // Data manipulation logic
            return $this->model->where('field', $data['field'])->get();
        }
    }
    ```

### TanStack Query Management

1. **Query Keys**: Centralized in `tanstackQueryKeys.ts`:

    ```typescript
    export const TANSTACK_QUERY_KEYS = {
        SOME_MODELS: 'some_models',
        GLOBAL_SOME_MODELS: 'global_some_models',
    };
    ```

2. **Query Invalidation**: After mutations, relevant queries are invalidated:

    ```typescript
    invalidateQueryKeys: [{ queryKey: [TANSTACK_QUERY_KEYS.SOME_MODELS], exact: false }];
    ```

3. **Query Generation**: Helper functions generate consistent query keys:
    ```typescript
    queryKey: generateUseGetAllQueryKey(baseKey, filters);
    ```

### Full Custom Business Lifecycle Example

1. User clicks "Accept Request" button in UI
2. React component calls `employeeServiceHook.acceptRequest().mutate()`
3. `serviceHooksFactory` creates a mutation with `IntentEnum.ACCEPT_REQUEST` intent
4. Request is sent to `/employee` endpoint with intent parameter
5. `RequestController@index` receives request, detects intent, calls `EmployeeService@acceptEmployee`
6. `EmployeeService` contains business logic, delegates to `EmployeeRepository` for data operations
7. `EmployeeService` dispatches `AcceptEmployeeJob` for background processing
8. Job execution progress is broadcast via WebSockets using `AcceptProgressEvent`
9. Frontend updates UI based on WebSocket events and refetches data when complete

## Custom Project Structure (with model user as an example)

## Rules

1. If storing file, use Storage::disk('public')->put()
2. Be opinionated
3. Use latest and stable approach
4. Creativity to make better code is welcome but avoid too much hallucination, stay at the current context
5. This project is using zod for frontend validation, so please use zod for validation instead of using react-hook-form or any other validation library
6. If i ask you about the errors, please explain logically why is that happen so I will understand deeper about the current issue
7. If you want to create custom business process logic other than basic CRUD, use the IntentEnum.php to store custom key that trigger those custom logic in controller, then add condition for those intent in the form request for specific case (either StoreRequest or UpdateRequest depending on the business process logic), so no more new controllers, route, etc, dont worry about IntentEnum.ts, because the vite will always regenerate its content if the IntentEnum.php updated
8. Make the code clean, modular, and generalized, but not too coupled
9. Don't delete anything related to developer comments or notes about // TODO: , // BUG: , etc
10. Any breaking change ideas must be asked first before integrating the code directly on the codebase
11. If i ask to add something, do only adding, DON'T remove other code, focus on the current context to maintain safe code
12. Im up for discussion, if there's anything to ask, ask away, it's better to ask first rather than changing the code with reckless behavior
13. CRUCIAL!: if editing existing code, do not replace the code with the comments like `ts // ...existing code...` it will make the code break and leave thousand of errors
14. CRUCIAL!: DO NOT DELETE UNRELATED CODE, even if it looks like a dead code, just leave it as is, and add the new code below the existing code, so it will not break the existing code
15. CRUCIAL!: DO NOT MODIFY UNRELATED CODE
16. CRUCIAL!: In every prompt i have tested and modified the generated code to match the expected result, so please do not modify the code that i have tested and modified, just add the new code below the existing codem
17. You have to use the docker command defined in [dc.sh](dc.sh) to utilize the docker container, and you have to use the docker-compose command to utilize the docker-compose container, otherwise we got EACESS error
18. If you wanna add frontend code, please learn from the existing code, and please use the same pattern as the existing code, so it will not break the existing code and maintain the consistency
19. Do not run laravel test because it will reset existing database
20. Do not run anything that will resulting code generation stuck like doing ./dc.sh shell laravel
21. Do not run build, because those process will stuck

## Test Case E2E Rules

1. Do not assume, always read and analyze the existing codebase pattern and its flow
2. Maintain clean code
3. Direct element selection is preferred.
4. You are encourage to define data- selector into the element that you want to select in order to do the objective above

## Crucial Notes

Warning: above all circumstances, do not remove the old code, your job is to implement a feature, not modify the entire codebase, **this is always happening at all times.**

Note: all previous code is tested and works fine, you only need to modify part of code to implement certain feature or logic that i requested. I say again, only part of code and that code is directly related to the logic or feature that i requested, if you wanna safely implement a feature, just add the code partially or make a new function, but most importantly if you do this, make sure to implement backward compatibility across the codebase you did change.

Note for frontend changes: about routing if you referring to laravel routes, for example

```ts
route('users.index');
```

do not do the code like above, do it like this

```ts
import { ROUTES } from '@/support/constants/routes';

route(`${ROUTES.USERS}.index`);
```
